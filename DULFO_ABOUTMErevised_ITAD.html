    <div>
    	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my childhood years, I either play inside or outside the house always with my neighbor friends.<sup>1</sup> 
		We played taguan, patintero, tumbang preso and other Filipino games.<sup>2</sup> We also played computer games in every computer shop near our street and sometimes I treat my friends with food and drinks.<sup>3</sup> My family always go out and relax in any malls every Sunday, it became our habit as we always want to chill and be stressed free.<sup>4</sup> Then during the time of summer when I was a child, I always go to Bicol province because that’s where my father’s family lives.<sup>5</sup> I always play with my aunt and uncles there especially with my grandfather and grandmother.<sup>6</sup>  I always get wounded as I always tripped when I run outside the house, they will treat my wound and buy me ice cream.<sup>7</sup>  Then whenever my mom comes from abroad, she always buy me everything I need and my wants.<sup>8</sup> Ever since I transferred school when I reached kinder 2, I never asked to be transferred anymore as my classmates in kinder 2 will always be my friends.<sup>9</sup> I always play tag with my classmates during elementary and sometimes they would treat me food.<sup>10</sup>  I also had many childhood crushes back then even one of my teachers, I was happy with what’s going during my elementary days.<sup>11</sup> Not only I met great friends in school but also I learned a lot from that school and got high grades.<sup>12</sup> I also learned how to draw when I was a kid, I always draw anime and cartoon characters that I always see on TV. <sup>13</sup> My mom  buys me gadgets whenever she sees me borrowing my from someone like the PSP and Gameboy, I was really spoiled back then.<sup>14</sup> My favorite childhood games were Pokemon, Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, NBA and lots more!<sup>15</sup> Then when I met my other relatives, I visit their houses during weekends and eat there and play with my cousins.<sup>16</sup> My mom enrolled me to swimming and taekwondo summer school where I really tried my best but I got lazy.<sup>17</sup> Though I was able to finish the swimming course and I finally learned how to swim, but I didn’t finished taekwondo because I felt like it wasn’t my style.<sup>18</sup> Whenever my mom is working abroad, my grandmother, grandfather and aunt takes care of me and the did everything to make me who I am today.<sup>19</sup> I can say my childhood days are so memorable and I won’t forget everything that has happened ever since.<sup>20</sup>

	<h2 id="teenage">Teenage Years</h2>
    <div>
    	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that during the teenage years of my life are the best one because I experienced and did everything that time.<sup>1</sup> 
		My highschool days are really the best because that time I don’t have that much responsibility yet and all I do is hangout with my friends.<sup>2</sup> Before going to school, we all go to a certain place to hang out because we always go to school very early.<sup>3</sup>  Everyday, we always have new topics to talk about and everyone is happy and we always have our each other’s back when there’s trouble.<sup>4</sup> Then during school time, we also talk, laugh and play in the classroom where we always get shouted on and most of our teachers always get mad at us.<sup>5</sup> Our whole group was notorious for being noisy everyday and we were always visited by the principal whom we became close later on.<sup>6</sup> But despite this, our teachers are still kind and friendly to us as some of them joined our conversations about baskeball and such.<sup>7</sup> It’s not something to be proud of but every year we always get called to the principal’s office and tells us to bring our parent or our guardian.<sup>8</sup> Of course when we get home our family gets mad and scolds us about it but later on they got used to it.<sup>9</sup> This time of my life is also where I had my first girlfriend, I was older than her by a year and our school year.<sup>10</sup> She was also my first kiss then and I truly loved her until we broke up when I graduated from highschool.<sup>11</sup> Also one of the reasons why this is the best time of my life because of the prom and graduation.<sup>12</sup> It was so fun as the first time I’ve experienced a prom night and we did it twice in 3rd year and 4th year respectively.<sup>13</sup> That night was really fantastic and I won’t ever forget what happened because I had so much fun with my friends and the new people that I met there.<sup>14</sup> After school, I usually hang out in my friend’s house with our other friends or play basketball everywhere near the school.<sup>15</sup> It was really really fun until we graduated and all of us separated ways because of different school selections.<sup>16</sup> In senior highschool, I got admitted to the Centro Escolar University Makati where I also met new friends and I also had fun with them.<sup>17</sup> Then in the 12th grade, I requested a transfer to the Manila branch because the transportation fee is really high compare to the transportation fee on the way to the Manila branch.<sup>18</sup> I was sad to leave the CEU Makati because I met so many nice people there and I had so much happy memories in there.<sup>19</sup> Then they finally granted my request of transfer and got admitted in the Manila branch of CEU.<sup>20</sup> I also met nice people in there and befriended with them, they’re not bad at all and I also had the same experience that I had in the CEU Makati.<sup>21</sup> The Senior High graduation was so much fun and everyone parted ways and said goodbyes, I truly believe my teenage years was the best part of my life.<sup>22</sup></p></blockquote>

    <h2 id="college">College Years</h2>
    <div>
    	<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just started my college life 2 years ago but I can already say I’m doing good because once again I met nice friends and I’m getting good grades.<sup>1</sup> 
		At the first day of the classes in college, I’m glad that one of my classmates is my former classmate in senior high and the other one is my former schoolmate in highschool.<sup>2</sup> I also met a lot of new faces and they were nice that day, I already befriended with some of them when the classes got dismissed.<sup>3</sup> I really don’t have a background about programming but when the prof first discussed it to us, I got excited and wanted to learn more about it.<sup>4</sup> After classes, my classmates and I always eat in the Gastambide street because there’s a lot of food stores in there.<sup>5</sup> Especially in trinas where we always eat there because of their delicious foods.<sup>6</sup> In the first year of our college life we had Saturday classes and the subject is NSTP where I chose the community service because it’s easier.<sup>7</sup> The first day of the classes were kinda awkward as all of us don’t really know each other but I talked with some of them and we became close.<sup>8</sup> They appointed me to be the class president because they’re the one who thought about first and so I accepted it.<sup>9</sup> The NSTP classes were fun because we helped poor people by donating foods, supplies and more.<sup>10</sup> The first year of college is also the time I had my second girlfriend which was my former classmate.<sup>11</sup> We helped each other’s works and we always pass our requirements in time so that there won’t be any more problems when going home.<sup>12</sup> It was very fun until it lasted and it made my college life happier because I almost felt that I might not finish this course but I was surprised that I was able to get good grades after.<sup>13</sup> Then pandemic happened and the second sem of the first year classes got cancelled because of it so we passed and I got good grades.<sup>14</sup> Also I forgot to mentioned the PE classes where we are asked to watch UAAP basketball games for grades.<sup>15</sup> Of course I liked it because I am a huge basketball fan and if I would want to, I can watch every basketball game of the UE basketball team.<sup>16</sup> Then the second sem of the PE classes is fun too, it’s about fencing and we were being taught on how to play it.<sup>17</sup> I really missed everything about the school especially my friends because it’s always fun when you learn in school with them.<sup>18</sup> That’s it about my college life because it’s still currently happening and who knows there are better things that will happen soon.<sup>19</sup> I do hope we are back to face to face classes because it’s hard to learn in online classes and it’s so much fun when you go to school.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote>
