		<hr> <br>
		
		<p>My name is Aeron B. David, most of my friends call me by the nickname of 'Ae'
		(pronounced as the letter 'A') which is short for Aeron. I am currently 20 years of age and will be turning 21 on October 13 this year. I live in my grandmother's house at Bagumbayan, Taguig City since I was a little kid because my mom has to work abroad to sustain our education and living expenses. I really love listening to music, playing online games, and traveling. My only dream is to finish my studies, live a comfortable life, and return all of the hardships that my mother went through abroad.</p>
		
		<p>I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of the East-Manila Campus. I must say that as of now, I am enjoing my college years even though sometimes it can be really stressful. With that being said, I am a student who is not that hard driven when it comes to my studies. I do what I can do and really try my best to survive and pass my subjects.</p>

		<p>Studies can be really stressful and one of my way to cope up with it besides playing games is listening to music. The genre that I listen to are alternative pop, pop, and country. There is this YouTube channel named MrSuicideSheep (I know it has an
		interesting name but itâ€™s not like that at all) who posts chill, vibey, and dance-along songs which I have downloaded a lot to my phone so I can listen to it anytime. It has the beat that is so good for long road trips and travel which is right up my alley.</p>
