		<hr> <br>
		
		<p>I am Kelcie Rhayne Laqui, and I'm from Sta Cruz Manila. I grew up living a simple and happy life. Everyone can agree that I am a cheerful kind of person. I have a lot of friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel comfortable with them. I enjoy their company since I am an only child. I believe that friendship is important in life so I treasure all of my friends as my brothers and sisters. I appreciate people who surround me. My friends say that I am a selfless person I always think of others before myself.</p>

		<p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of the East-Manila. I am a simple type of student who is eager to learn and who never give up easily. I enjoy facing challenges in life to be my stepping stone to being the best version of myself. I love listening to music and watching series. It gives me relaxation whenever I'm having a bad day. I always believe in "you need to do something today so that your future self will thank you for it".</p>

		<p>The goal I'm currently pursuing is the dream of making my parents proud, I want to graduate and repay my parents hard work. I'd like to provide them with the life they deserve. I aspire to be a happy individual who can be proud of my accomplishments. I can't wait to be able to say, â€œI did it!".</p>
