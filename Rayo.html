		<hr> <br>
		
		<p>I, Rafael Luigi Rayo, was born in Norzagaray Bulacan on August 24, 2000. 
		I graduated from Primary and Secondary Education at the University of the East and currently pursuing a BS Information Technology course. I'm an above-average student who is committed to achieving goals, well-oriented, God-fearing, enthusiastic, and a man of my principles. Also, I'll describe myself as a multitasker because I really love to do various kinds of stuff in one sitting. so by that, it will accelerate and expand my knowledge to the possible outcomes it might produce. As I grew up, I discover a lot of strengths and weaknesses of myself which shaped me from who I am now.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, I do a lot of piano tutorials for myself, playing volleyball as my hobby, loves to capture spectacular sceneries, and loves to make old school poems. 
		Collecting quotes is the weirdest thing that I've ever done in my entire life. Also, I love writing about different travel destinations that will be included in my bucket list. Playing online games makes me more out of the blue and I really feel the satisfaction of using them. I am just an ordinary guy who is confidently taking risks, no matter what will await, no matter what will be the consequences are. It's better to try harder than to die without even trying. My existence is capable to explore more, to look for the brighter side.</p>
